Welcome to window.py.

window.py provides simple abstractions for making sophisticated TUIs.
We'll handle scaling your window panes relative to the size of the terminal,
fitting them to their content, and drawing them relative to eachother.

Positioning them is as simple as defining how they're ordered in a list.

You don't have to worry about cursor positioning (unless you want to), or
drawing off the screen. window.py takes care of overflow and text wrapping.

To get started:

  Install the library with "sudo python setup.py install".
  Have a nosey around the examples directory.
  Enjoy.
